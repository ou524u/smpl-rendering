he man stands on one leg and balances a ball on his foot. He kicks the ball into the air and catches it with his hand. He tosses the ball behind his back and catches it with his other hand. He throws the ball up again and does a backflip, then catches the ball with his mouth. He spits the ball out and juggles it with his hands and feet. He ends with a somersault and a clap.
